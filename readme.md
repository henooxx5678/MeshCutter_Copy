(Sorry for the messy code, my programming skills weren't very developed at that time)

## How To Use

- Using the namespace `MeshCutting`.
- Call the method `MeshCutter.CutFlat` for a flat blade cutting. (You can find that method in "MeshCutter.FlatBlade.cs")
- Call the method `MeshCutter.CutCurved` for a curved blade cutting. (You can find that method in "MeshCutter.CurvedKnife")
